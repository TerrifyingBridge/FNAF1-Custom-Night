# README
This file is mostly to describe what is happening in this specific repository. Most of the code explanation will be in [Overview](Overview.md), so if you're looking for that please navigate to that file instead. For those who are still here, this repository is to house my simulation and analysis of Five Nights at Freddy's Custom Night, specifically for Bonnie and Chica. There is a file for the class that runs a simulation of a singular night (NightSim.py), along with other python files that run specific graphs and plots based on what I wanted to look into specifically. 

Just so it's said out loud, I chose python because it's one of the easiest languages (that I know at least) where I can just jump in and start doing stuff. Plus, since everything is relatively small for each specific simulation, we don't need to worry about optimization. There is no GUI for this program, there isn't an executable or anything fun like that. It's a very simple project that I thought would be fun to make. Admittedly, this means there isn't too much to look at coding wise, and I doubt anyone would want to play around with the code either (especially since I don't plan on optimizing it), but it'll be here for the world to see. For all three of you. Regardless, I hope you are at least mildly intrigued and have at least some curiosity satiated. Again, all of this information can be found in [Overview](Overview.md).
