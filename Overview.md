# Five Nights at Freddy's Custom Night 
Hello and welcome to my repository on a simulation and analysis for Five Night's at Freddy's Custom Night, specifically for Bonnie and Chica. In this specific file, you will be able to find a detailed explanation of what the problem is, how the code works, as well as what results we can determine from these simulations. I will try to reference specific segments of code while explaining them (when that happens) as well as showing each of the graphs the code generates. There will be a lot to get through, so I'll shut up and refer you to the table of contents below!

| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Intro to Game / Problem](#Intro-to-Game-/-Problem) | A brief description on what this game is about as well as the specific question we are trying to answer.                                                                                              |
| [AI Breakdown](#AI-Breakdown)                       | A detailed explanation of how the AI works for each of the animatronics.                                                                                                                              |
| [Simulation Explanation](#Simulation-explanation)   | A detailed explanation for how the simulation works. First, the section starts off talking about the logic for how to set up these simulations, the explains how each of this is implemented in code. |
| [Results of Simulation](#Results-of-Simulation)     | Some graphs that are the result of running the simulation as well as some basic statistics from running the simulation many times over.                                                               |
| [Analysis of Results](#analysis-of-results)         | A broad overview of what the results actually mean, and what we can learn from them. This section also talks about how the simulation isn't exactly perfect and where it could be improved.           |
| [Conclusion](#conclusion)                           | Concluding remarks about everything, as well as my ending thoughts with regards to everything.                                                                                                        |
